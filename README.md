Analyzing Hotels Dataset In Python
Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis

Project Overview

This project involves analyzing booking and cancellation data for two types of hotels: City Hotels and Resort Hotels. The analysis identifies trends in cancellation rates, pricing, seasonal factors, and booking volumes. The insights derived from this analysis help understand customer behavior and provide actionable recommendations for hotel management to optimize pricing strategies and minimize cancellations.

Key Insights from the Analysis

1. Cancellation Rates:

Approximately 37% of bookings were canceled, indicating a significant impact on hotel revenue.
Resort Hotels experienced fewer cancellations compared to City Hotels.

2. Price Sensitivity:

Prices for Resort Hotels tend to be higher than City Hotels, especially during weekends and holidays.
Higher prices correlate with increased cancellation rates, showing that price fluctuations are a significant factor in customer decisions.

3. Seasonal Trends:

The highest booking volumes occurred during May, June, July, and August, with August being the peak for both confirmed and canceled reservations.
January saw the lowest confirmed bookings but the highest cancellation rate, suggesting it may be an opportune time for marketing promotions to boost occupancy.

4. Country-wise Cancellations:

Portugal had the highest number of cancellations, possibly indicating a pattern in customer behavior by region.

Visualizations and Graphs

Cancellation Percentages: Bar graph showing 63% of bookings were confirmed while 37% were canceled.
Monthly Booking Trends: Grouped bar graphs highlighting the peak and low months for bookings and cancellations.
Price Fluctuations: Line graphs showing average daily rates (ADR) for City and Resort Hotels, with Resort Hotels displaying higher volatility.
Price vs. Cancellations: Graphs proving that higher ADR leads to more cancellations.

Recommendations

Pricing Strategy: Reduce rates or provide discounts to lower cancellation rates, especially during high-demand periods.
Deposit Policies: Implement stricter deposit policies to deter cancellations.
Targeted Promotions: Launch marketing campaigns, particularly during January, to counteract the high cancellation rates and boost confirmed bookings.

Tools & Technologies

Python: Used for data analysis and visualization (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data exploration and reporting.

How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hotel-booking-analysis.git
2. Install the necessary Python libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open and run the Jupyter notebook (HotelBookingAnalysis.ipynb) to explore the data and visualizations.

Future Improvements

Incorporate machine learning models to predict future cancellation likelihood.
Analyze the impact of different booking platforms on cancellation rates.
